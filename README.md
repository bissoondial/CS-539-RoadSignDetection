# I. Problem Overview
To ensure safety and effectiveness, autonomous vehicles are ordered to obey the rules of the road. Doing so requires the vehicles to observe and adhere to stop signs, traffic lights, speed limits, or any other signage in unmapped environments. Our goal is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signage into several classes.
