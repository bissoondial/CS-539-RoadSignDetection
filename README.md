CS-539 Final Project

# I. Problem Overview
To ensure safety and effectiveness, autonomous vehicles are ordered to obey the rules of the road. Doing so requires the vehicles to observe and adhere to stop signs, traffic lights, speed limits, or any other signage in unmapped environments. Our goal is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signage into several classes.

# II. Dataset

In this project we utilized the full Road Sign Detection Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection consisting of 4 classes of images of different road signs. Additionally we incorporated images from the GRSTB dataset which is a well known dataset for various German road sign images. This diverse dataset consists of 43 different classes, however we selected 4 of which were consistent with the classes of our other dataset to compare the performance.
