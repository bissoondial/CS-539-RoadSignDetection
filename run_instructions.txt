 MODEL ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

To run our image classifier model run the "run_model.py" file which loads the primary road sign dataset with insatnces from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset
and passes this data into our CNN.  *All models experimented with throughout the course of this project reside in CNN.py*

If there are any additional images for the specified classes you wish to test, the data in the images and annotations folder can be replaced through using script.py. To
load your own data that fits the 4 specified classes, specify the folder path and label for images you wish to incorporate through a method call to "create_xmls_for_dir".
This code will generate corresponding XML files for your images. To automate moving images to the images folder, please use the "move_images" method.
